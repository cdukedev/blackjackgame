## Instructions

1. We will each be responsible for different parts of the game. Each of us will work within our own branch. You can merge the program description, psuedo code and IPO from the main branch into your own branch. Once you have your part of the program working, you can merge it into the -- "testmain" -- branch. We will use this to test the program before we make the final merge it into the main branch.
